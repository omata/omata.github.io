> **Meet Marvel comics’ new Thor - she’s not what you’d expect!**

> *Learn more & see some exclusive art from the upcoming comics series*: <http://bit.ly/1ymF6LN>

> Marvel is excited to announce an all-new era for the God of Thunder in brand new series, ***THOR****, *written by Jason Aaron (Thor*: God of Thunder*, *Original Sin*) complimented with art from Russell Dauterman (*Cyclops).*

> This October, Marvel Comics evolves once again in one of the most shocking and exciting changes ever to shake one of Marvel’s “big three” – Captain American, Iron Man and Thor – Marvel Comics will be introducing an all-new **THOR, GOD OF THUNDER**. No longer is the classic male hero able to hold the mighty hammer, *Mjölnir*, a brand new female hero will emerge will who will be worthy of the name **THOR**. Who is she? Where did she come from and what is her connection to Asgard and the Marvel Universe?

> “The inscription on Thor’s hammer reads ‘Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.’ Well it’s time to update that inscription,” says Marvel editor Wil Moss. “The new Thor continues Marvel’s proud tradition of strong female characters like Captain Marvel, Storm, Black Widow and more. And this new Thor isn’t a temporary female substitute - she’s now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!”
