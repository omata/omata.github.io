> When 17-year-old George Hotz became the world’s first hacker to crack
> AT&T’s lock on the iPhone in 2007, the companies officially ignored
> him while scrambling to fix the bugs his work exposed. When he later
> reverse engineered the Playstation 3, Sony sued him and settled only
> after he agreed to never hack another Sony product.

> When Hotz dismantled the defenses of Google’s Chrome operating system
> earlier this year, by contrast, the company [paid him a \$150,000
> reward](http://www.zdnet.com/chrome-os-security-holes-found-patched-7000027445/) for
> helping fix the flaws he’d uncovered. Two months later Chris Evans, a
> Google security engineer, followed up by email with an offer: How
> would Hotz like to join an elite team of full-time hackers paid to
> hunt security vulnerabilities in every popular piece of software that
> touches the internet?
>
> </p>
>
> Today Google plans to publicly reveal that team, known as Project
> Zero, a group of top Google security researchers with the sole mission
> of tracking down and neutering the most insidious security flaws in
> the world’s software. Those secret hackable bugs, known in the
> security industry as “zero-day” vulnerabilities, are exploited by
> criminals, state-sponsored hackers and intelligence agencies in their
> spying operations. By tasking its researchers to drag them into the
> light, Google hopes to get those spy-friendly flaws fixed. And Project
> Zero’s hackers won’t be exposing bugs only in Google’s products.
> **They’ll be given free rein to attack any software whose zero-days
> can be dug up and demonstrated with the aim of pressuring other
> companies to better protect Google’s users.**
